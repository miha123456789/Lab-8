<h1>SSL</h1>

<p>Let's start with the basics: What is SSL? An SSL certificate encrypts the data that goes from a user’s computer to the target website and back. Every time a user enters information into your site, SSL makes sure it can securely travel from their browser to your web server.

    What does this mean for website owners? Websites communicate with their customers to share information, and so that they can buy products or services safely with you online. Without getting overly technical, adding an SSL certificate creates a safe connection for those kinds of activities. The most important thing to grasp about SSL is that anything that needs to be secure online should under the protective umbrella of an SSL certificate.
    
    You might have gone to some lengths to bolster your site security but without SSL, it's unlikely to be enough. Website are free to operate online without an SSL certificate, but you must ask yourself whether you want to take the chance that yours is susceptible to hacking? Probably not.
    
    It was once sufficient to depend solely on basic antivirus software and firewalls for the protection of your business and home computer. That’s no longer the case; today’s users are bombarded with malware. Securing customer trust and confidence should be up there with the most critical factors to consider for anyone operating a business online.
    
    Consider the motivation behind any external party getting hold of your visitors data. Their intention won't be good; it's most likely their purpose is to manipulate the information or use it for identity theft. As such, the onus is on the website, or online business to take active steps to counter these measures, in a effort to look after these customers. In doing so, you’re ensuring continual confidence in the use of your web services, higher customer retention and, more importantly, the reduction of data theft.
    
    To sum up, an SSL certificate is more than protect your transactions and your customers’ private information. It will also help to build trust between you and your customer base all the while making your business more reputable.</p>
